# DVD_RENTAL
 Development of DVD Rental System using MySQL, Php and Apache Web server (XAMPP). Also constructed a database with tables and Php for web interface using appropriate script and code.

Created three MySQL database tables and write php scripts to read, insert & delete data.
The first database table contains the names of my favourite four(4) movies. The second table will be 
a list of actors who appear in the movies. The third table will be an associative table that describes the 
relationship between actors and movies (which actors appear in which movies). Actors and movies have 
a many-to-many relationship (an actor can be in multiple movies and a movie can have multiple actors).
